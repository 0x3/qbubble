Quantum Bubble

The game is very similar to traditional four in a line: Two players, wins the first one to get a four in line. The catch is that one token can be in many positions at the same time, but collapse into only one definitive position. The collapse happens when no more tokens can be added to the same cell and still have no more than one token per cell after collapse. 

The key to win the game is to force certain collapse patterns by carefully choosing the superposition. Multiple fours in lines are possible at the same time when collapse happens, so the winner is the one who makes more four in lines.
