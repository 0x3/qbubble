Quantum Bubble

The game is very similar to traditional four in a line: Two players take turns dropping a token at a time and wins the first one to get a four in line. The catch is that one token can be in many positions at the same time, but collapse into one definitive position. The collapse happens when it is impossible to add new tokens in superposition. I.E. Two cells can store at most two tokens in superposition.

The key to win the game is to choose a superposition to force a winning collapse pattern. Multiple fours in lines are possible at the same time when collapse happens, so the winner is the one who makes more four in lines.
